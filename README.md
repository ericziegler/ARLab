# ARLab
Demo app that shows how to load local USDZ files using two methods:
1. QuickLook
2. RealityKit

## Notes:
- QuickLook's AR functionality has been broken since iOS 15.0.1. Because of this, you can only view 3D objects in "void space"

## TODO:
- Anchoring needs to be adjusted in RealityKit
- Actually write a companion guide that explains the demo
